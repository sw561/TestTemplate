TestTemplate
============

Template Files for writing code which includes tests and debug options.

./run.sh takes an optional argument. If there is no argument or the argument is 0, then no diagnostics are run in the code. Otherwise checks will be run for every function call.

./test.sh runs the test scripts and reports which tests passed or failed.

Each of these bash scripts calls make automatically.
